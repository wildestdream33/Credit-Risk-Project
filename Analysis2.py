# 1. Initial Variable Retention
# In the raw dataset, we started with 122 variables. The first major selection step was to drop columns with more than 20% missing values. This is crucial because high-missing columns often lead to unreliable predictions and can introduce bias if filled with imputed values.
#
# Key Dropped Variables:
#
# Features like COMMONAREA_MEDI, NONLIVINGAREA_MEDI, and FONDKAPREMONT_MODE had significant missing values and were removed.
# Variables Retained:
#
# Financial Indicators:
# AMT_INCOME_TOTAL, AMT_CREDIT, AMT_ANNUITY, AMT_GOODS_PRICE
# Reason: These features are central to evaluating an applicant’s financial situation, which is critical for assessing credit risk.
# Demographic Information:
# DAYS_BIRTH, DAYS_EMPLOYED, DAYS_REGISTRATION, DAYS_ID_PUBLISH
# Reason: These variables provide insight into the applicant’s age, employment stability, and registration duration, all of which are important risk indicators.
# Social Circle Indicators:
# OBS_30_CNT_SOCIAL_CIRCLE, DEF_30_CNT_SOCIAL_CIRCLE, OBS_60_CNT_SOCIAL_CIRCLE, DEF_60_CNT_SOCIAL_CIRCLE
# Reason: These features reflect the applicant's social connections and potential past defaults, which can be predictors of risk.
# Outcome: The initial shape after dropping high-missing columns was 72 variables, retaining features that are critical for modeling credit risk.
#
# 2. Handling Categorical Variables
# Categorical variables were transformed using one-hot encoding, increasing the number of columns from 72 to 161. This step was necessary because machine learning models require numeric inputs.
#
# Categorical Variables Included:
#
# CODE_GENDER:
# Encoded into CODE_GENDER_F and CODE_GENDER_M.
# Reason: Gender can influence credit risk profiles, and splitting it into binary features prevents assuming any inherent order.
# ORGANIZATION_TYPE:
# XNA values grouped under Other and then one-hot encoded.
# Reason: Organization type reflects the nature of the applicant’s employment, which can affect their risk profile. Grouping XNA reduces noise from unknown values.
# NAME_EDUCATION_TYPE, NAME_FAMILY_STATUS, NAME_HOUSING_TYPE:
# Transformed into binary columns.
# Reason: These features indicate the applicant’s education level, family status, and housing situation, which are relevant predictors of financial behavior.
# 3. Conversion of Binary Columns
# Binary columns like FLAG_OWN_CAR and FLAG_OWN_REALTY were converted from 'Y'/'N' to 1/0 for numeric representation.
#
# Selected Binary Features:
#
# FLAG_OWN_CAR:
# Indicates car ownership. Applicants owning a car might have different financial obligations, affecting risk.
# FLAG_OWN_REALTY:
# Reflects real estate ownership, which can influence the applicant’s financial stability.
# TARGET:
# The outcome variable indicating default (1) or non-default (0).
# Outcome: This conversion ensured all input features were numeric, facilitating further analysis and model training.
#
# 4. Standardization
# The numeric features were standardized using StandardScaler to have a mean of 0 and variance of 1.
#
# Why Standardization?
#
# Standardization helps ensure that features with different scales (e.g., AMT_CREDIT vs. DAYS_EMPLOYED) do not disproportionately influence the model.
# It also prepares the data for PCA, which is sensitive to feature scaling.
# Numeric Columns Standardized:
#
# Financial Metrics: AMT_INCOME_TOTAL, AMT_CREDIT, AMT_ANNUITY, AMT_GOODS_PRICE
# Demographic Metrics: DAYS_BIRTH, DAYS_EMPLOYED, DAYS_REGISTRATION, DAYS_ID_PUBLISH
# Social Circle Features: OBS_30_CNT_SOCIAL_CIRCLE, DEF_30_CNT_SOCIAL_CIRCLE
# 5. Handling High Skewness and Kurtosis
# Transformations like log, Yeo-Johnson, and winsorization were applied to reduce skewness and kurtosis, making the variables more normally distributed.
#
# Key Transformed Variables:
#
# AMT_INCOME_TOTAL, AMT_CREDIT:
# High positive skewness was reduced using log and Yeo-Johnson transformations.
# Reason: Income and credit amount can have extreme values, which distort model training. Reducing skewness helps stabilize their influence.
# DEF_30_CNT_SOCIAL_CIRCLE, DEF_60_CNT_SOCIAL_CIRCLE:
# High kurtosis was addressed using winsorization to cap extreme values.
# Reason: High kurtosis indicates heavy tails, suggesting many outliers. Capping these values improves model robustness.
# Outcome: The skewness and kurtosis for these variables were significantly reduced, making them more suitable for linear models and PCA.
#
# 6. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
# PCA was performed to reduce dimensionality while retaining 95% of the variance. The optimal number of components was reduced from 20 (before handling skewness/kurtosis) to 19 after transformations.
#
# Why PCA?
#
# PCA helps reduce the feature space by selecting components that capture the most variance, reducing the risk of overfitting.
# It also helps eliminate multicollinearity by creating uncorrelated components.
# Outcome of PCA:
#
# Total variance before PCA: 22.56
# Total variance after PCA: 21.89
# Number of components: Reduced from 20 to 19
# Reason for Reduction: By addressing high skewness and kurtosis, the transformed features became more normally distributed, allowing PCA to capture the same variance with fewer components.
# Final Variable Selection
# Based on the output analysis, the key variables retained for the final model build are:
#
# Financial Variables:
#
# AMT_INCOME_TOTAL, AMT_CREDIT, AMT_ANNUITY, AMT_GOODS_PRICE
# Reason: These are direct indicators of the applicant’s financial profile and are critical for credit risk assessment.
# Demographic Variables:
#
# DAYS_BIRTH, DAYS_EMPLOYED, DAYS_REGISTRATION, DAYS_ID_PUBLISH
# Reason: These provide insight into the applicant’s age, employment stability, and historical behavior.
# Categorical/Binary Variables:
#
# CODE_GENDER_F, CODE_GENDER_M, FLAG_OWN_CAR, FLAG_OWN_REALTY
# Reason: These variables are indicators of demographic and lifestyle characteristics that can influence credit risk.
# Social Circle Variables:
#
# DEF_30_CNT_SOCIAL_CIRCLE, DEF_60_CNT_SOCIAL_CIRCLE
# Reason: Default rates within the social circle are strong indicators of potential risk.
# Conclusion
# The output shows a comprehensive selection and transformation process that effectively reduced noise, handled missing data, addressed skewness and outliers, and reduced dimensionality using PCA. The retained variables represent a balanced mix of financial indicators, demographic characteristics, and behavioral metrics, all of which are crucial for building an accurate and robust credit risk prediction model.
#
# This selection process and transformation strategy should improve the model’s predictive performance, reduce overfitting, and ensure that the features used are informative and statistically sound.
